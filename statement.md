##  Problem Statement

We all rely on contact information every day—whether it’s friends, classmates, colleagues, or service providers. But most people store contacts in random places like notebooks, phone notes, or scattered text files. This makes it difficult to find information quickly or keep it updated. To make this process more organized, there is a need for a simple system that stores contact details in one place and lets users manage them easily.

The Contact Book Application was created to solve exactly this problem. It is a simple, console-based Python program that lets users add, search, view, update, and delete contact information. All data is stored in a text file so that it stays available even after the program closes. The project also demonstrates practical use of Python basics like functions, loops, file handling, and menu-driven interaction.

# Objectives of the Project

- To create a small and easy-to-use digital tool for storing contact details.
- To help users quickly search for a contact when needed.
- To make it possible to update information without having to rewrite everything.
- To allow removal of old or unwanted contact entries.
- To provide a clean, beginner-friendly menu system.
- To follow modular coding practices using Python functions.
- To ensure contacts remain saved across multiple uses of the program.

# Functional Requirements

### 1. Add Contact  
Users can enter a name, phone number, and email. The details are saved in a structured format in a text file.

### 2. Search Contact  
Users can search by name or phone number. The search is case-insensitive and shows matching results.

### 3. List All Contacts  
Displays all saved contacts in a neat and readable format. If no contacts exist, the user is informed.

### 4. Update Contact  
Users can update any part of a contact. They can also keep existing values by leaving inputs blank.

### 5. Delete Contact  
Allows removal of a specific contact. If the name doesn’t exist, the system informs the user.

### 6. Exit  
Closes the application safely.

# Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability  
The system should be simple, clear, and easy for anyone to use.

### Reliability  
Data must be saved correctly and consistently, without errors.

### Maintainability  
The code should be modular, making it easy to add new features in the future.

### Performance  
The application should run quickly and not require much system memory.

### Portability  
The program should run on any operating system that supports Python.
